forcing someone to do something has a negative effect on your soul.

Is your aim to
   to reduce the number of abortions
   to force people not to have abortions
   to make sure people know that abortion is evil

because the last two work against the first.

not just wrong, evil.   Lots of things are wrong, and life is often about choosing amongst several kinds of wrong.  And you can't choose for other people.  You can often force them into your choice, but you can't choose for them.

Evil isn't just "really wrong", it is irrideamably wrong.  So wrong it is unforgivable.  So wrong that I can't understand you.  If you do evil, or even think about doing evil, then you are beyond help, understanding, or forgiveness, until you admit your evil

The problem with deciding that someone is evil is that it prevents you from putting yourself in their shoes.  If you can't put yourself in the shoes of a person that might have an abortion, you can't imagine the kinds of things that might cause you to make one choice o

The longer we treat people who have abortions, or consider having abortions as evil

Thinking that abortion is evil gets in the way of thinking about why people choose abortion, and what (other than fear) might get them to choose another path.
