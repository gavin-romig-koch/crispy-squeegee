Self-avowed practicing homosexuals "cannot maintain the highest standards of holy living in the world."

This is hate speech, and allowing it to remain in the text that defines United Methodism is a sin for which we all United Methodists are guilty.  It is not hate speech because of what it says or the way it says it.  This is not about whether or not it's true, or finding the correct wording for a difficult truth.   It is hate speech because homosexuals are the only sinners, of all the sinners in the world, that the Book of Dicipline says this about.
